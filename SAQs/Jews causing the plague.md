a. Almost half of the entire population was dying, and people didn't know who else to blame besides the jews. In the first paragraph it says that "many suggest" that the jews were the cause for the epidemic. Because there wasn't any evidence for the jews causing the plague, it shows that they blamed them for no reason. 

*a revised: Almost half of the entire population was dying because of the Bubonic Plague. (this is easier to give evidence for and you dont need to talk about jews)*

b. Conrad claimed that jews wouldn't have spread the disease because the disease also killed themselves. It says in the passage that "they died in droves from the exact same disease as the Christians." This shows that they died from the same disease, so they wouldn't have intentionally caused it if would kill them.

*b revised: Jews didn't spread the bubonic plague (would be better cuz other part could be in evidence)*

c.
