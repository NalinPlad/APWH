### Close to WW2 End

1944 - Yalta Conference
	FDR wanted free and fair elections after the War

However Stalin did not give any guarantees in the countries Russia was now occupying. Stalin wanted a buffer between him and the other European Countries

### Potsdam Conference 
FDR died, and new president Truman met with Stalin and also wanted free elections in Europe.

Stalin ignored truman and occupied European countries. Truman did not want to risk another war

### United States
was fortunate that most WW2 fighting did not occur in the US. Infrastructure was untouched by war, as european nations were trying to rebuild

### Soviet Union
The russians lost many people and lots of infrastructure was destroyed. Population was large and even though they lost they still had lots of population to spare. Since stalin tried to industrialize their nation recovered quickly.
