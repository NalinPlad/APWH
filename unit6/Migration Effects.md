Migrations has effects on two things:

## Home Society
Usualy men would be the ones leaving home country to go find work somewhere else. Some would leave without a replacement man. Most times husband would leave, but wouldnt leave before son or someone else will take care of family. The family will sometimes migrate after the husband has been there for a while.

Gender roles actually changed a lot too, because if there was no replacement man to take care of the family, so women had more power, and a stronger voice

## Receiving Societies
Migrants brought there own culture and hangout in their own enclace. Ethic enclave would affect societies culture, food, language, and religion.

Chinese enclaves - Migrated to southeast Asia where they would partake in government and have pretty good jobs in charge of opium growing and even had significant hands in the opium distribution

In the Americas at first they would partake in mining but soon they would partake in the construction of railroads most importantly the Transcontinental railroad 

## Chinese were hated
American Congress would pass a law to groups, called Chinese Exclusion Act

Australia would do the same even though Chinese population was slowly going down. 

## Indian Enclaves
Some Indians would be forced to work in islands like the island of Mauritius, which was owned by the British, as indentured servants.

They would grow sugar cane and build railroads.  

They would bring ideas like the Caste System but this would fall off quickly because it had no real strength in a non Indian society 

They would immigrate to south east asia and would become the largest workforce in the area 

## Kangani 
New system that would send whole families to work in plantations instead of just sending one man who entered as an indentured servant

They work in places like malaya ceylon and Burma 

## Irish Enclaves 
Most moved because of famine. Did lots of public work, like canal building. They mostly lived in low cost houseing tenements. 

Americans hated them because they were Roman Catholic

Americans embraced their music, St. Patrick Days, and the increased spread of Catholicism 

They would help with the creation of labor unions

## Italian Enclaves
Italians experience the same problem in US as Irish. They also emigrated to Argentina as well. Argentina was more accepting
