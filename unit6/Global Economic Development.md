## Global Economies
The Imperial nations are coming and they are coming for your Raw Materials and food. Raw Materials are needed for there industrial factories. Food is needed for their growing urban populations 

## Goes against their whole belief 
Making extra food to grow the population was not a normal thing 

Most African nations use Subsistence Farming 
Subsistence farming - they only grew enough food to sustain their community 

French and British people would introduce Cash Crop farming. No longer about growing for the community it is now about growing crops that could make money.

## Meat and Guano
Growing Middle class would want better goods and this included beef. Ships with new refrigerated technology allowed the transfer of beef

With growing agriculture the demand for fertilizer increased. The best fertilizer at the time would be bat/bird droppings known as Guano 

## Examples of Raw Materials 
- Cotton (Egypt) After the civil war in the United States Great Britain was looking for a new place to grow their cotton. Forced Egypt to turn their crops into Cotton 
- Rubber (Amazon rainforest and Africa) Used for tires
- Palm Oil (East Africa) -  great lubricate for their factories 
- Diamonds (South Africa)

## Consequences 
1. interconnectedness of the world economies. Raw material from colonies would be used to build stuff in the imperial nations and then sold back to colonies 

2. The shift to Cash Crops weakened many nations. Since these imperialized nations focused on growing one crop, if anything happened to that crop in the global economy it could ruin their economy 

## Economic Imperialism 
The best way to think of Economic Imperialism is that the country doing the Imperializing (Mother Country) does not take over the government or try to rule them. 

Instead, they try to dominate their economies by exploiting them via their government or companies to get the cash crops, minerals, or whatever they want from their economic colony.  Sometimes this is done almost entirely by businesses.

#### Examples
- India- British East India company forced their country to grow cottonÂ 

- China - demanded porcelain, silk, and tea . Britain would trade opium with China to force them to trade more

- Latin America- USA would invest to ensure trading partners. Britain invested to build the port of Buenos Aires


## Banana republics
