## War Did Not Start Immediately 
At first Austria-Hungary decided to send an Ultimatum to Serbia

An ultimatum - a final demand or statement of terms, the rejection of which will result in retaliation or a breakdown in relations

- Serbia had 48 hours to accept the demands 
- Serbia agreed to most of the demands but wanted to negotiate and talk about one of them
- Then on July 28th 1914 Austria Hungary declared war on Serbia 

## Germany 
Germany gave Austria a Blank Check which meant they would support Austria Hungary Empire through anything 

They declared War on Serbia immediately after on Serbia immediately after

## Mobilization of Russia 
Mobilization is the action of a country or its government preparing and organizing troops for active service 

The moment A-H rejected Serbia’s offer Russia mobilized their troops 

Germany decided to give Russia an ultimatum to stop and not interfere

Russia Ignored it 

Russia main reason to support Serbia was to retain warm water ports  

## France Involvement 
Because of the Triple Entente France supports Russia

They also ignores Germany’s Ultimatum 

France urges Britain to join ( they decide to wait it out) 

## Italy Does not get involved 
Italy stays neutral 

Does not have a good relationship with Austria Hungary 

Says the Triple Alliance was meant as a defensive pact and that Germany and Austria Hungary were being the aggressor

Italy betrays the triple alliance and one year later declares war on Austria Hungary 

## Mobilization of Germany 
Since Germany and Austria were allies Germany declared war on Russia 

Germany knew that France and Russia were allies so Germany declared war on France 

## Germany had a Plan
Germany believed they could not a fight a 2- Front War 

Thought Russia would be slow to mobilize (They were not)

Believed Austria Hungary would “help them out”

Planned to take France quickly then focus on Russia 

## The Schlieffen Plan 
France was fortified and ready for the German invasion

So Germany came up with this plan believing they could march there 750,000 thousand troops into Belgium and get into France that way 

Belgium said No and Germany declared  war on Belgium 

They committed many atrocities, “Rape of Belgium”

Germans burned homes and executed civilians 

23,700 Belgian citizens were killed 

Great Britain finally had enough and decided to declare war on Germany

## Deaths
The total number of military and civilian casualties in World War I, was around 40 million. There were 20 million deaths and 21 million wounded. The total number of deaths includes 9.7 million military personnel and about 10 million civilians.

## Old School mentality
- War is fun 
- Bayonet charges are cool 
- Horses are really effective 
- Dying for your country was an honor 
- We don’t need to update our uniforms 

## Trench Warfare 
- Trench warfare is a type of combat in which opposing troops fight from trenches facing each other 
- Opposing Armies decided to dig miles of parallel trenches to protect themselves from enemy fire 
- Trenches were like a maze stretching for miles 
- This war was also multi ethnic meaning from the imperial colonies Britain and France would bring people from Africa and Asia to fight the war for them.

- Dysentery is a disease involving the inflammation of lining of the large intestines. This disease struck the men in the trenches as there was no proper sanitation. Trench Foot was a common occurrence for the soldiers in the trenches

- No Man’s Land -  bombed out territory between enmy trench-lines that was crossed by tons of barbed wire and dotted with mines 
- Soldiers were forced to run thru No mans land to try and get a small piece of land.

## United States
The United States has a large German population. United States was practicing isolationism yet still trading with England 

Isolationism is a policy of avoiding political or military involvement with other countries 

People in America believed the war should stay in Europe and America should not get involved
Opinion slowly changes first with The Rape of Beligum 

Propaganda is information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view.

USA government supported the Allies. Germany started practicing unrestricted Submarine warfare. 

Which meant any merchant ship, trader ship or passenger ship was a target of German U Boats 
Germany sinks a British passenger ship called the Lusitania on May 7th 1915

128 Americans died 
Public Opinion was almost completely against Germany by now  

Germany believes that it is a matter time before the USA gets involved. They decided to send a telegram to Mexico. It was intercepted by the British and then sent to the United States. 

Why would Germany be trying to contact Mexico? 

Germany asked in the Zimmerman Telegram for Mexico to declare war on the United States
Mexico would be promised Texas, New Mexico and Arizona if they agree

United States was furious and the people were finally urging the government for war. On April 6, 1917, President Woodrow Wilson signed this joint resolution, ending America's neutral stance on the ongoing global conflict joining the side of the Allies
