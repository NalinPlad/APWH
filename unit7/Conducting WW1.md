## War Did Not Start Immediately 
At first Austria-Hungary decided to send an Ultimatum to Serbia

An ultimatum - a final demand or statement of terms, the rejection of which will result in retaliation or a breakdown in relations

- Serbia had 48 hours to accept the demands 
- Serbia agreed to most of the demands but wanted to negotiate and talk about one of them
- Then on July 28th 1914 Austria Hungary declared war on Serbia 

## Germany 
Germany gave Austria a Blank Check which meant they would support Austria Hungary Empire through anything 

They declared War on Serbia immediately after on Serbia immediately after

## Mobilization of Russia 
Mobilization is the action of a country or its government preparing and organizing troops for active service 

The moment A-H rejected Serbia’s offer Russia mobilized their troops 

Germany decided to give Russia an ultimatum to stop and not interfere

Russia Ignored it 

Russia main reason to support Serbia was to retain warm water ports  

## France Involvement 
Because of the Triple Entente France supports Russia

They also ignores Germany’s Ultimatum 

France urges Britain to join ( they decide to wait it out) 

## Italy Does not get involved 
Italy stays neutral 

Does not have a good relationship with Austria Hungary 

Says the Triple Alliance was meant as a defensive pact and that Germany and Austria Hungary were being the aggressor

Italy betrays the triple alliance and one year later declares war on Austria Hungary
