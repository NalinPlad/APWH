## The Start of WWII 
- Begins with the invasion of Poland 
- Hitler would use a brand new tactic called Blitzkrieg 
	Blitzkrieg- method of offensive warfare designed to strike a swift focused blow at an enemy using tanks and airsupport 

- Was a total war 
	Total war is when huge amounts of government control over citizens, economies and colonies was exercised 

All citizens were engaged in war production( buying war bonds, women producing weapons in factories government deciding production
- Example No cars were produced in the USA during WWII only tanks, etc

Even though America would use women to do work Japan would not

## 2 Mistakes
##### Pearl Harbor
- The United states were waiting for an excuse to join this war and Pearl Harbor was perfect for them
- The Japanese were not able to take out most of their ships 
- United States had more people and more material 

###### Germany Invades the Soviet Union
- Germany would fail to invade Great Britain 
- They would turn their focus on the Soviet Union 
- This would break the nonaggression pact with Stalin 
- Germany invading Russia in the winter a horrible idea

lebenstram - belief that the nazis needed more space to grow food for the german people

## New Weapon
- Napalm is a  new weapon that would be used in WWII also called firebombing
- This would be so dangerous it could even burn water 
- Even though it became a big part of WWII it would be a bigger weapon during Vietnam War
