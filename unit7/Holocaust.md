The systematic mass slaughter of European Jews in Nazi concentration camps during World War II. 

Which included other people they deemed inferior. Nazi Germany and its collobarators systemically murdered six million Jews in German occupied Europe, and another five million other “non-Aryans”.

It is not one singular event but a series of events that led to the mass extermination of jews and other races in Europe.

## Three main events

#### Night of Broken Glass
- Early in November 1938, 17 year old Herschel Grynszpan, a Jewish youth from Germany, was visiting an uncle in Paris. 
- He learned that his father had been deported to Poland. 
- On November 7th, wishing to avenge his father’s deportation, Grynszpan shot a German diplomat living in Paris.

- When Nazi leaders heard of the news they used this pretext to launch a violent attack on the Jewish community. 
- On November 9, Nazi storm troopers attacked Jewish Homes, businesses and synagogues across Germany and Austria and murded close to 100 Jews 
- November 9 became known Kristallnacht or “Night of Broken Glass

#### Flood of Refugees and Isolating the Jews
After Kristallnacht, Jews starting leaving in droves to other countries like Great Britain and the United States.

Once countries stop taking refugees, Hitler ordered Jews in all countries under his control to be moved to designated cities. These towns were called ghettos or segregated jewish areas.

**Ghettos** 
	Nazis would seal off the ghettos with barbed wire and stone walls 
	Hoped that the Jews inside would starve to death or die from disease 
	Even under the horrible conditions, the Jews hung on. 
	Teachers would teach lessons in secret schools 

#### The “Final Solution”
Since Hitler was becoming impatient with the Jews, he implemented his plan which was called the Final Solution 

- Final Solution it was actually a program of genocide the systematic murder of an entire people. 
- The Nazis had to eliminate other races, nationalities, or groups they viewed as inferior as “Subhumans.” Included gypsies, Poles, Russians, homosequals , the insane, the disabled, and the incurably ill, But **mostly the Jews**

Units from the SS ( Hitler’s elite security force) went from town to town to hunt down Jews. They would round up men, women, children and even babies and took them to isolated spots and shot them. 

Jews not shot would be sent to concentrations camps, or slave-labor prisons. One of the most famous death camps called **Auschwitz** the largest of the extermination camps.
