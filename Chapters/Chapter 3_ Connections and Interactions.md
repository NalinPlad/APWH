### Silk Road

Silk was a symbol of status <br>
Peasants sometimes gave up argriculture to make luxury goods

Yokes, saddles, stirrups made camels, horses, and oxen more efficient <br>

### Buddhism in China 

*841-845* | Imperial decrees ordered:
- ~260k monks/nuns to become regular citizens
- Monasteries, temples, shrines were destroyed
- Buddhists forbidden to use gold, silver, copper, iron, and gems for images

`Chan school of Chinese Buddhism` was dominant during Song Dynasty *(Became `Zen` in Japan by 1200)*

> **Neo-Confucianism** rejected religious aspects of Buddhism and Daoism but used morals of Buddhist teachings + texts of Confucianism
> 
> *Arrived in Japan around 1240*

Basically ==Buddhism was assimilated into Chinese culture==, wasn't the defining thing

### Sea Roads

`Srivijaya` became major center for Buddhism and attracted thousands of monks

> Religious structures: Borobudur, Angkor Wat

### Sand Roads

Arab merchants wanted ==gold== (west Africa). In return, people in the west got ==salt== from the sahara and other things. <br>
Ivory, kola nuts, slaves were wanted in the desert, mediterranean basin, and beyond. 

> Large states/empires: Ghana (700-1200), Mali (1230-1500), Songhay (1430-1591), Kanem (1571-1603)

`Timbuktu` became important trading and Islamic center

### Connections across Islamic World

Muslim merchants like Arabs and Persians were dominant in all Afro-Eurasian trade. <br> *800* | Established a commercial colony in `Canton` (southern China)

Water management like Persion reserviors and irrigation spread througout the Islamic world, contributing to "Islamic Green Revolution" (increase in food and population) #themes/technology-and-innovation
