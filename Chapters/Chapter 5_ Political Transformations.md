# The Making of a Russian Empire

What drew Russians across Siberia was ==animal pelts==

Political leaders and educated Russians defended frontiers, improve power of Russian state, brought `Christianity` civilization and enlightenment to savages

## Experiencing the Russian Empire

Russian auth needed from the native people an **oath of allegiance** and `yasak` (tribute).

Loss of hunting grounds and land to settlers -> natives ==dependant on Russian markets==

Requirements to pay fees and restrictions on land forced pastoralists to ==abandon nomadic ways==

Many adopted Russian language and Christianity

## Russians and Empire

Rich agricultural land, valuable furs, mineral deposits -> Russia is one of the ==great powers of Europe== by *18th century*

Russia expanded east via military rivalries with major powers

Russia ==Europeanized== their culture (first with Peter the Great (1689-1725))

> Russia is confused as to whether its a Europe-like country or Slavic/Asian country



# Asian Empires

## Making China an Empire

*1644-1912* | `Qing (Manchu) Dynasty`

Qing rulers kept ethnically distince by not marrying with Chinese, but they used Chinese language, governing techniques, and Confucian teachings

*1680-1760* | Military effort to take control over regions like Mongolia, Xinjiang, Tibet (driven by security concerns)

Qing gave ==local notables== power to govern as cheaply as possible, but sometimes they abused their power

Local people ==weren't assimilated== into Chinese culture, and their cultures were respected

> **Court of colonial affairs** new office that ruled the new land seperately

> The incorporation of inner Eurasia into Russian and Qing empires eliminated nomadic pastoralists as an option

## Muslims and Hindus in the Mughal Empire

- Akbar added Hindus into the elite of the empire
- Supported construction of Hindu temples
- Removed the `Juzya tax`
- Softened some Hindu restrictions on women

[[Mughal Empire#Treatment of minority groups]]

Some Muslims disagreed with the acceptance of Hinduism (Emperor `Aurangzeb` reversed `Akbar`s policy)

## Muslims and Christians in the Ottoman Empire

==Turkish women== had big political influence and had property rights

Conflict between Ottoman Empire (Sunni) and Persian Safavid Empire (Shia)

*1453* | `Constantinople` fell to Muslims, renamed `Istanbul` -> Byzantium fell

In `Anatolia`, Christians converted to Islam. In the `Balkans` it was mostly Christian

The Ottoman Empire was seen as a threat to Christendom (but was also admirable)
