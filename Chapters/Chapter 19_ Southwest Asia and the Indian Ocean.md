# Southwest Asia and the Indian Ocean (1500-1750)

## [[Ottoman Empire]] (1300-1750)

`Ottoman Empire` grew from small state in `Anatolia` because of:

- The shrewdness of `Osman` (founder) and his descendants
- Controlled link between EU and Asia on `Dardanells strait`
- Army that used traditional skills of Turkish cavalryman
- Gunpowder

[[Chapter 5_ Political Transformations#^008af9|Constantinople fell to Sultan Mehmed II]]

> **Battle of Kosovo** Conquered strong `Serbian` kingdom *1389*

`Suleiman the Magnificent` (son of Selim I) expanded power to Eastern EU (Balkans and Mediterranian)
- War with `Venice` left them weak and needed to pay the empire ==tribute==

### Military

[[Ottoman Empire#Military Bureaucratic recruitment]]
Military consisted of **Janissaries** (yeni cheri in Turkish), Christian prisoners of war as ==military slaves== ^ce50e8
- Got them from conquest in the `Balkans`
- Fought on foot with guns
- Had to collect taxes

> Galley-equipted ==navy== that they could afford to maintain but wasn't as important

Everyone in the military/bureaucracy who spoke `Osmanli` (court language) belonged to `askeri` (military class) *exempt from taxes*
- Sultan provided justice, military provided protection, and everyone else (`raya`) payed taxes to support (like `Fuedelism`)

### Crisis (1585-1650)

Size of Janissaries and cost of them increased
- To pay Janisssaries, sultan reduced # of landholding cavalrymen
- Money going into living expenses and military equipment went into treasury
- [[Chapter 19_ Southwest Asia and the Indian Ocean#^23b4e4|Cheap silver]] from Americas caused inflation -> landholders went bankrupt ^549407

*1590-1610* | Lots of revolts in Anatolia

> Sultan used to leading an army not dealing with gov issues

Land grants in return for military service fell, ==tax farming== rose

> **Port of Izmir** became an important trading center *1650*

Trade was too expensive


## [[Safavid Empire]] (1502-1722)

`Shi'ite` Islam (neighbors are `Sunni`)

Differred in culture and language

> **Hidden Imam** Last in a series of descendants of Muhammad's son in law `Ali`. Any ruler is considered a temporary stand-in for them until they return as a `Messiah` at the end of time.

*1598* | `Shah Abbas I` (5th ruler) made `Isfahan` the capital

### Istanbul vs Isfahan

`Istanbul` was next to ocean -> more trade (EU merchants) <br>
`Isfahan` wasn't next to ocean -> less trade

Both were similar in culture and city design

Istanbul had a lot more people

### Economy

Silks and carpets were important, most people farmed or herded

- Harder to pay troops
- Inflation due to [[Chapter 19_ Southwest Asia and the Indian Ocean#^549407|cheap silver]]  ^23b4e4
- Decline of overland trade because of mismanagement of silk

*1722* | `Afghan` invaders captured `Isfahan` and the empire fell


## [[Mughal Empire]] (1526-1761)

`Babur`: Founder #person<br>
`Akbar (grandson)`: Expanded the empire and established main power 

[[Chapter 5_ Political Transformations#Muslims and Hindus in the Mughal Empire]]

> **mansabs** grants of land given in return for service

### Decline

Regional powers, foreign invasion (afghans), and European intruders (french traders) caused the decline

*1739* | `Nadir Shah` invaded Mughal capital

*1723* | `Nizam al-Mulk` (vizier of sultan) gave up and became independant along with other officials
