# Unit 2.3: Exchange in the Indian Ocean

## Indian Ocean Sea Trade

THE trading network of this period (more than Silk Road)

Traded luxury goods but it was more about **bulk items and raw goods** like wheat, sugar, rice, and timber (+ was a lot cheaper)

Religion was also transfered

> #### Mansoon Winds
> From Nov-Feb the winds blew southwest allowing ships to travel from India to Africa
>
> From Apr-Sep the winds switched to northeast allowing ships to travel from East Africa to India
>
> *Predictable winds allowed trade to be a lot less risky*

### Technology

Magnetic Needle / Compass, Astrolabe

**Dhow** Triangular sail or a lateen sail (created by muslim sailors) allowed sailors to go against the wind instead of waiting for the mansoon to change directions

**Stern post rudder** Made it easier to steer ships
