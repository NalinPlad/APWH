##### Contextualization
During the period from xxx to xxx, industrialization was allowing states to expand more quickly, and manufacture goods at a rate that was never before seen. Many people from around the world were beginning to migrate to new places for work or to claim land for development. Large European contries were beginning the colonize and industrialise Africa, and through the Scramble for Africa and the Berlin Conference, almost all land on Africa was claimed by proccess of European Imperialism.

##### Thesis
Despite the argument that efforts by Christian missionaries heavily motivated European imperial expansion, because of larger economic and nationalistic reasons, Christian missionaries did not heavily motivate European imperial expansion, and were merely used to either accelerate other proccesses, or used as an excuse for actions.

##### Body Paragraph 1
Economic motivations were one of the primary causes of Imperial Expansion by Europeans into Africa. As we can see in (doc 1 and 3), Europeans used christianity and religion as a way try and make people more hard working, focused, and happy in their working conditions, which would lead to a higher volume of output in many markets, and by extension higher economic gain after European intervention. This system of religously converting people to better fit into a certain type of work is remminicent of the Jannisary units from the Ottoman empire, in both situations the people were converted to a religion to unify them and make them better fit their new positions. (Doc 4) also serves as evidence to this point, with it showing how a diamond mining company went from unorganized and confused to quiet and secure following the imperial expansion and colonization of the area, which is important as diamonds and other precious metals were one of Africas most valued exports, and the economic gain was most likeley very large. (Doc 2) also shows an African King and a European coming to an agreement, which would allow European expansion into the area, allowing for more economic gain in Madagascar. This document was intended to let the British know that the agreement had been going smoothly, and called for more workers to be brought to the area. All of these documents show examples of economic processes that would benefit Europeans. These documents present evidence as to why European imperial expansion was motivated by the possibility of economic gain. Other projects such as the Suez Canal, and rubber farming industries where also expanded apon by Europeans.

#### Body Paragraph 2
Nationalism was very prevalent in the 19th century, and was one of the major efforts that motivated the European imperial expansion into Africa. (Doc 5) shows French soldiers and officers in a colony in Africa. We can also see cannons and other evidence of military action being taken to secure the area. This document shows how the french were showing lots of nationlistic ideas, with flags visible on the top of the poster. (Doc 6) is a very clear indication of nationalism, with Portuguese rules being imposed on missions in Mozambique. This document was written by officials from Portugal, and shows how the Portuguese valued nationalism a lot, as they specificaly sent these rules to a foriegn continent to make sure they were imposed on the people living there. You can also see examples of nationalism in The White mans Burdon. People would believe that it was their duty to bring up the lives of people in different areas of the world, and can be seen in the expansion into Africa.

#### Conclusion
Despite religion being very prevalent in the 19th century, the promise of economic gain and nationalistic ideas proved to be far more important motivators during the European imperial expansion into Africa. Some may point to how (doc 2) shows how religous conversion could be a motivator for expansion. But they will fail to notice that religion only played a small part in motivating imperial expansion. In some cases, it was used as a way to justify certain acts, or to motivate and unify workers. In (doc 5 - 6) we can see how nationalistic ideas motivated people to come to Africa and settle it, bringing their own rules and culture in the process. In (doc 1 - 4), we see large economic successes brought people to the area, as they saw diamond mining companies increase their profits following european expansion, similarly to Indian textile manufacturing industries being optimized by industrialization. All in all, religous missionaries played a small role in motivating European imperial expansion into Africa, and if anything, they were used as and excuse for Europeans actions, or they were used to unify workers to increase economic output and were converted for nationalistic reasons.
