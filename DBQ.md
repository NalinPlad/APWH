##### Contextualization
During the period from xxx to xxx, industrialization was allowing states to expand more quickly, and manufacture goods at a rate that was never before seen. Many people from around the world were beginning to migrate to new places for work or to claim land for development. Large European contries were beginning the colonize and industrialise Africa, and through the Scramble for Africa and the Berlin Conference, almost all land on Africa was claimed by proccess of European Imperialism.

##### Thesis
Despite the argument that efforts by Christian missionaries heavily motivated European imperial expansion, because of larger economic and nationalistic reasons, Christian missionaries did not heavily motivate European imperial expansion.

##### Body Paragraph 1
Economic motivations were one of the primary causes of Imperial Expansion by Europeans into Africa. As we can see in (doc 1 and 3), Europeans used christianity and religion as a way try and make people more hard working, focused, and happy in their working conditions, which would lead to a higher volume of output in many markets, and by extension higher economic gain after European intervention. This system of religously converting people to better fit into a certain type of work is remminicent of the Jannisary units from the Ottoman empire, in both situations the people were converted to a religion to unify them and make them better fit their new positions. (Doc 4) also serves as evidence to this point, with it showing how a diamond mining company went from unorganized and confused to quiet and secure following the imperial expansion and colonization of the area, which is important as diamonds and other precious metals were one of Africas most valued exports, and the economic gain was most likeley very large. (Doc 2) also shows an African King and a European coming to an agreement, which would allow European expansion into the area, allowing for more economic gain in Madagascar. This document was intended to let the British know that the agreement had been going smoothly, and called for more workers to be brought to the area. All of these documents show examples of economic processes that would benefit Europeans. These documents present evidence as to why European imperial expansion was motivated by the possibility of economic gain.

#### Body Paragraph 2
Nationalism was very prevalent in the 19th century, and was one of the major efforts that motivated the European imperial expansion into Africa. (Doc 5) shows French soldiers and officers in a colony in Africa. This document shows how the french were showing lots of nationlistic ideas, with flags visible on the top of the poster. (Doc 6) is a very clear indication of nationalism, with Portuguese rules being imposed on missions in Mozambique. This document was written by officials from Portugal, and shows how the Portuguese valued nationalism a lot, as they specificaly sent these rules to a foriegn continent to make sure they were imposed on the people living there.
