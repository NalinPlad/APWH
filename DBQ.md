##### Contextualization
During the period from xxx to xxx, industrialization was allowing states to expand more quickly, and manufacture goods at a rate that was never before seen. Many people from around the world were beginning to migrate to new places for work or to claim land for development. Large European contries were beginning the colonize and industrialise Africa, and through the Scramble for Africa and the Berlin Conference, almost all land on Africa was claimed by proccess of European Imperialism.

##### Thesis
Despite the argument that efforts by Christian missionaries heavily motivated European imperial expansion, because of larger economic and nationalistic reasons, Christian missionaries did not heavily motivate European imperial expansion.

##### Body Paragraph 1
Economic motivations were one of the primary causes of Imperial Expansion by Europeans into Africa. As we can see in (doc 1), Europeans used christianity and religion as a way try and make people more hard working, focused, and happy in their working conditions, which would lead to a higher volume of output in many markets, and by extension higher economic gain. This system of religously converting people to better fit into a certain type of work is remminicent of the Jannisary units from the Ottoman empire, in both situations the people were converted to a religion to unify them and make them better fit their new positions. (Doc 2) also serves as evidence to this point, with it showing how a diamond mining company went from unorganized and confused to quiet and secure, which is important as diamonds and other precious metals were one of Africas most valued exports, and the economic gain from the imperial expansion and colonization of the area was most likeley very large.
