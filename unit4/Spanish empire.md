# Spanish Empire
Took over the aztecs and incas. Got powere because of military and disease brought over there. They held onto power with a new form of goverment. They taxed natives and forced them into christianity.

### Catas
“Castas” was a term shared by both Spanish and Portuguese, it was a caste used to identify the different interacial citizens and their various racial combinations. There were so many races because during the conquest of the Americas, the male soldiers started having children with Amerindian women and eventually African women too.

### Encomienda System 
A nobleman, or person would be granted responsibility for a certain number of natives. They would give the natives, protection christian education. In return the native would return with tribute(labor). Close to the feudal system.

### Hacienda System 
Spanish would grant land holding (Haciendas)  to conquistadors and spanish nobles who were willing to make the trip over to the Americas 
Once reaching the Americas that land would be under their control to farm or lease to other Spaniards

People would work on these lands and most likely never stop because of the low wages or huge amount of debt they will rack up

### Mit’a System 
Originally under the Incas. The spanish decided to use it. People had to work for public project a certain amount of time per year. When the Spaniards came to America they were in search of gold. What they did find was silver
