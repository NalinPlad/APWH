#### Taxation
Taxes were paid in copper or silver coins. This forced farmers to sell their products to be able to pay the tax. 

Coin currency helped merchants thrive during this period  which lead to more tax revenue.

#### Treatment of minority groups
Situation was similar to the [Mughals](obsidian://open?vault=APWH&file=unit3%2FMughal%20Empire), with a minority group in control. Manchus made up 2% of the population and kept many old Chinese ways. They did a few new things, including
