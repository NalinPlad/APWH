#### Printing Press
Gutenberg’s press. Constructed mainly out of wood.

Letters used in the press were made out of metal and covered in ink.

Paper was placed on the letters and then “pressed” by the machine.

#### Martin Luther (1483-1546)
German priest. Troubled by what he sees in the Catholic Church. He opposed the sale of indulgences.

Believed that you didnt need a priest or anything, just faith adn scripture. He wrote *95 Theses* and nailed it to the door of the Church.

His views spread quickly with the help of the printing press

Challenged the catholic church and led a movement known as the Protestantism.

He got excommunicated by the Pope.

New churches as created outside the authority of the Pope. Lutheranism was one of them.

The Catholic church reformation happens. They stop the sale of indulgences but not much else.

Some long term effects: Permanent split between Catholic and Protestant Churches, Increased religious toleration, Weakened papacy, stronger governments.
