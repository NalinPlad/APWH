1501-1722

Named after Safi al-din who led a Sufi order of **Shiaâ€™a Muslims**

Relied on access to gunpowder.

Limited because of the ottomans and the mughals

Much less divers than the Ottomans. They were mainly Iranians and Turks

They benifitted from being at the center of trade

#### Goverment
Centralized structure under a Shah(king). Shah couldnt make rules without approval from prime minister. Local Leaders were called Khans. Khans had to provide an army.

#### Military
Like Ottomans, they took christians and converted them to Islam and forced them into military service. They built a strong military with goal to convert people.

From 1514-1750 the Safavid fought the Ottomans 9 times. They were rivals because of religous differences. Issues like this can still be seen in Iran and neighbors.

#### Tax
Complex taxattion system

Tax of farm products, number of livestock, sales tax, tolls on road, and other things(similar to America)

Allowed funding of military and elaborate daily life in the capital.

#### Treatment of minority groups
