Design

This section is about some of the design choices present in my album art. First of all, the band name. I choose to replace SUPERTRAMP with ARAWAK, which was the first tribe that Christopher Columbus "met" when arriving in the New World. Also, for the I choose the change the font for the band name because when I set it to the original font, it didnt look that good, and a serif font looked better in my opinion. 

On the front of the album I changed the Album title to "NEW Breakfast in America"(The title is on the Menu the lady is holding). And of course I change the orange juice to coffee.
