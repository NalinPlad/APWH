## Meiji Restoration
Goverment feared that other powers would attack. They believed that they needed to modernize

To do this they **learned from American industrial ideas**. Led to capitalism being introduced. Also hired people from US to come and implement ideas.

Westernized japan a lot, but was a success, **led to japan being an imperial power**

## German Belgium revolution

#### Belgium
spread from britain to germany. Made posible by large coal deposits. They used this to manufacture many products.

**Failures** -  Revolution didn’t change the hierarchy of rich and poor. It also greatly increased the wealth gap difference between the rich and poor.

Success - The Industrial Revolution made Belgium an independent Kingdom.

Mostly was a failure

#### German
Germany started its industrialization in the 1840s and 50s with the construction of railroads, development of coal mining, and iron/steel production.

Germany also took a lead in the chemical and electrical industries. By 1914 the country was producing half the world’s electrical equipment. Considered a success.

## Muhammad Ali's Egypt’s Industrial Revolution
Muhammad Ali Pasha was the Ottoman ruler of Egypt as well as the man who attempted to industrialize Egypt.

Egypt needed to industrialize because the factories in Europe created goods that were cheap, which destroyed the Egyptian economy because their man made goods weren’t as popular.

Ali increased the production of cotton in Egypt, He then encouraged and attempted to create factories that produced clothing, food, and other goods, they also created textile industries, started food processing plants, and built dams and railroads to help with it all.However, the economy continued to decrease, Egypt went into debt, and had to shut down their factories.

### Failures
* The leadership was failing due to the leaders focusing on cotton and less domestically grown crops. The country relied on single exports.

- Muhammad Ali’s succesors were not as effective as him, their focus on cotton production at the expense of other crops mean that Egypt had to rely on a single export. 

- They also lived extravagant lifestyle, borrowing money from European banks who later used Egypt’s dept to dictate its policy. 

- Didn't have access to coal as European countries had, so factories had to rely on more expensive, less efficient power. 

- Had competition with other countries who put an import tax on their cloth and Egypt could not match their prices.

## Chinese Self-Strengthening Movement 
The Chinese Self Strengthening movement was a period of attempted rapid modernization through reforms in military, diplomats, and education inspired by Western government and culture.

Chinese government attempted to gain exclusive trading rights in China. Government wanted control of what came in and out of the country.

The Chinese Self-Strengthening Movement was a **failure** because they didn’t have good centralized government. 

## Ottoman Empire

**19th century** - Ottoman Empire starting to crumble due to the Empire refusing to modernize. For example, while other states like great britain began industrial revolution, Ottomans relied on manual agriculture. This led to famine and unemployment

Introduced **Tanzimat Reforms** - Series of Ottoman reform movements with the intention to modernize the old empire, heavily influenced by European ideas

The reforms included:
	“Noble Edict of the Rose Chamber” in 1839, which guaranteed life and property rights, instituted tax regulations, outlawed execution without trial
and
	“Imperial Edict” in 1856, which promised equality in education, government appointments, and administration of justice to all regardless of creed

The Ottoman industrial revolution was a failure because their attempts were too late compared to other developing countries. It left workers jobless and reduced internal sources of taxes, led to the europeans taking control of Ottoman finances.

Basically too little too late
